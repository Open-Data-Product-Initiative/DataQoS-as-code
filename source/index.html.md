## Introduction

Intro here

## Specification aims and aspects

**Specification aims:**

* ...

**Note!** 'Open' refers to the openness of the standard. Any kind of connotations to open data (a different thing) are not intentional, intended, or desirable.

## Document structure

**LEFT COLUMN: Navigation**

The left column is navigation which enables fluent and easy movement around the specification. 

**MIDDLE COLUMN: Principles and components**

The middle column contains detailed information about the included components and related options. This is the theory part. 

Note! Mandatory elements and attributes are listed separately in the definition tables. This enables user to construct minimum viable specification more easily and fast. https://schema.org provided ready-made definitions are applied when ever possible instead of re-inventing the wheel. 

**RIGHT COLUMN: Examples**

The right column contains YAML formatted examples of how the specification is used. In the future other output formats are added on request basis. YAML can easily be converted to JSON if needed. 

> Example of YAML formatted snippet from the Open Data Product Specification:

```yml
monitoring:
  url: https://monitoring.com
```


<aside class="notice">
The YAML examples are not based on any real data product, but exemplify the usage of Open DataQoS as Code standard.
