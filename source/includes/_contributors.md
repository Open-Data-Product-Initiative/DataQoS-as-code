# Editors and contributors

This specification is openly developed and a lot of the work comes from community. We list all community contributors as a sign of appreciation. The editor (and initial creator of the the specification) is Jarkko Moilanen. Editors take the feedback and draft new candidate releases, which may become the versions of the specification.
